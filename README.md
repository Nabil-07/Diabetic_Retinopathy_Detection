# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, leading to retinal lesions and potential vision loss. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent blindness, as DR is irreversible.
Manual diagnosis of DR by ophthalmologists is time-consuming, costly, and can be prone to misdiagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis systems, particularly deep learning techniques, offer a more efficient and accurate alternative.
Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has shown remarkable performance in medical image analysis, including the detection and classification of DR in colour fundus images.
This project reviews and analyses the state-of-the-art methods for detecting and classifying DR in colour fundus images using deep learning techniques, highlighting their effectiveness in this context.
